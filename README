A Cocoa class to read iPhone-encoded (CgBI) PNG files into NSImage.

Could easily be ported to Cocoa-touch (replace NSImage with UIImage) but iPhone libpng can read
iPhone-encoded PNG files just fine.

If the original PNG isn't CgBI encoded then it will be returned unmolested.

Requires that you link with zlib.
